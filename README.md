A Library is a curate collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for borrowing .Library is one of the most important sources of knowledge for students at an educational institute...It provides physical or digital access to materiel and many may be a physical location or both. A Library is collection of books, newspapers, maps, E-books, database Etc. So here I want to discuss physical library a college Library .In college library is one of main sources from where whole college students get knowledge and borrow books for later reading and return on specific time. The basic operations are performed are adding a new member, new book, update previous store data ,search data this may be books, members and members and the facility borrowing and returning books. So all of these operations are performed through traditional library System that includes registers so all of that operations are very tedious and time-consuming and these operation performed on daily basis that make them so tedious and time consuming  To overcome these issues, we need to introduce a concept of automation of libraries at our educational institutes. This automation system will be much faster than traditional and also save a lot of time and reduces cost of library management. Through that system we can easily search a member or book .we cannot see bunch of registers for looking a specific information .we just type keyword and doing that we can find any data that we store in our data base quickly and efficiently. this provide us update facility by that we can update any data that store in database .In traditional system first we look/search data that we want to update so for that we have to see many registers that is very time-consuming job by that system we just type name of information in few milliseconds we can find information and update it. Automation system also provide additional security and backup facility and this system make library work much faster and easy  The design of that application is easy to use for every type of users this may be management members or simple users so this provide a simple and user guide interface by that all type of users can use it and this app also provide facility of report generation which gives a detail information about books borrowed by students and faculty and make users possible to get hard copy of related reports
